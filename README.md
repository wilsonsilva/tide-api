Ruby interface to Tide's bank RESTful API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tide-api'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tide-api

## Usage

Tide uses `Access Tokens` to allow access to the API via OAuth 2. You can find more about authentication on 
[the official API reference](https://tideapi.github.io/docs/#authentication).

Follow the documentation until you have an `Authorization Grant Code`. I'm developing a command-line utility to
automate the authentication process.

```ruby
require 'tide/api'

client = Tide::API::Client.new

# Authentication
auth_grant_code = 'CBCAzT2L6A5oFZyE78R2TtYYtaJ60er0' 
tokens = client.fetch_tokens(auth_grant_code)

# Fetching companies
companies = client.fetch_companies

# Fetch accounts
accounts = client.fetch_accounts(companies.first.id)

# Fetch transactions 
transactions = client.fetch_transactions(accounts.first.id)
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies, configure git hooks and create support files.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

The health and maintainability of the codebase is ensured through a set of
Rake tasks to test, lint and audit the gem for security vulnerabilities and documentation:

```
rake bundle:audit          # Checks for vulnerable versions of gems 
rake qa                    # Test, lint and perform security and documentation audits
rake rubocop               # Lint the codebase with RuboCop
rake rubocop:auto_correct  # Auto-correct RuboCop offenses
rake spec                  # Run RSpec code examples
rake verify_measurements   # Verify that yardstick coverage is at least 100%
rake yard                  # Generate YARD Documentation
rake yard:junk             # Check the junk in your YARD Documentation
rake yardstick_measure     # Measure docs in lib/**/*.rb with yardstick
```
